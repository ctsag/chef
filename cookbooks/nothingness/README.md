# Chef Cookbook : Nothingness

This cookbook is responsible for setting up a pipelined development chain, consisting of an Chef server, a Chef workstation, a QA box, a staging box and a production box.

The setup consists of basic security and convenience settings, installation of essential user and development level packages and configuration of a Jenkins CI server.
